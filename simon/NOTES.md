# Quick notes on the process I took to get started

sudo apt install npm

mkdir redsprite
cd redsprite

npm install expo-cli

expo init DingDong
(Actually "./node_modules/expo-cli/bin/expo.js init DingDong" because expo was installed locally not globally.)

cd DingDong

npm start
-- failed (couldn't launch "expo start", I think due to path issues) --

-- start android emulator --

expo start
